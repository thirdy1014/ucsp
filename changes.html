                        <p style="text-align: left;">At the hands of terrible incidents, the development of our city had to come to a halt with the first confirmed covid-19 case in the city last March 18, 2020. With this matter at hand, enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) was imposed to Cebu City for around 3 months until it was eased to a general community quarantine (GCQ) last June 2020. During this period, many businesses had to shut down operations, public transportations were paralyzed and many people were left to rely on government aid due to unemployment. Around April 2020, the unemployment rates started to reach double digits in Central Visayas, leaving around 900,000 Filipinos unemployed, which has led to many people asking for an ease in restrictions regarding the implemented lockdown. In addition to the economic crisis, numerous health problems also arose. This included the easy covid-19 outbreak in the Cebu City Jail due to its overpopulation by over 1000%. Fast forward to today, Cebu City is currently under Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) which is less strict compared to ECQ but not as much as GCQ. Vaccination is now accessible to the Filipinos although this doesnâ€™t mean our problem regarding this covid-19 pandemic has been solved. Presently, the world is facing a new variant of the coronavirus, the delta variant. Our present vaccines were not designed to protect us from this variant, which is why our governments and health organizations continue to remind us to stay alert and safe despite being vaccinated. As of last September 4, 2021, the Department of Health reports that Cebu City has over 3,514 active cases which is still not a good sign for the end of this pandemic. Over these 16 months of covid-19 exposure, our city has suffered a great loss in terms of its educational system, religious/church activities, government projects and transactions, and its working conditions.</p>

                    <div class="description" data-aos="fade-down"><h2>Educational System</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">In regards to its educational system, schools in Cebu City have resorted to doing distance learning or online classes, although, presently, there has been news that some schools will be able to implement limited face-to-face classes. Students now lack the ability to apply learnt skills into the real world, which include real life social interaction with fellow students and teachers or lesser social interactions in general due to limited internet connectivity. In addition to these new traditions are being made with the presence of online classes, such as students are now more independent when it comes to learning, making him/her more self-motivated and allowing him/her to experience the world as an adult, alone.</p>

                    <div class="description" data-aos="fade-down"><h2> Church Activities</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">In terms of church activities, many churches were forced to close down and stop all face-to-face activities such as the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, thus the emergence of online mass during ECQ. Different sacraments, such as marriages and baptisms, were forced to reschedule because large gatherings were heavily prohibited up until the enforcement of MECQ and GCQ. Furthermore, most of the church donations have been going towards funds for covid-related necessities instead of directly for the church itself.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to government transactions and procedures, voting procedures have changed because voters now fill up the voting/ballot form at home instead of having to fill them up at voting centers. In order to support the population, the government also signed two stimulus packages into law which are the Bayanihan I and II acts, giving financial aid to affected workers and many more. Lastly, compared to the pre-covid era, the government also changed its transactions and the concentration of their government spendings towards health and covid-related necessities, such as when they offered free covid vaccination and mass covid testing.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left;">One of the biggest areas that the covid-19 pandemic hit were the working conditions of people. This was clearly seen in the rise in the unemployment rate of Central Visayas from 3.5% in January of 2020 to 7.1% in January of 2021, leading to twice as many Filipinos financially unstable. Many people have also resorted to working from home and making their own personal online business as another source of income during these difficult times. Not only this, but a lot of Cebuanos have been experiencing job insecurities knowing that their employment is not assured because of many budget cuts and unemployed people willing to work for lesser amounts.</p>
